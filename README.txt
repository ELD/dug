Build instructions: just type 'make'

Extra Notes:
There's a CMakeLists.txt included because the IDE I used (CLion) uses CMake as the build system (which generates a Makefile).
Because of my use of Boost, I could not use the autogenerated Makefile and crafted my own, simple one, instead.

Also, note that this project uses the Boost Program Options library. I compiled the Boost libraries in my home directory under the .local
directory. It should have the proper permissions for other users to link against them. In case it doesn't compile for you, let me know. I
could have missed something with library permissions. In addition, because it uses Boost, the Makefile statically compiles the binary so
you don't have to muck around with your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
